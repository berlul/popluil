## Maintainers
[stretch07](https://github.com/stretch07) and [not-a-java-dev](https://github.com/not-a-java-dev)  
All contributions welcome.
## Installation

Userscripts require a userscript manager to be installed on your computer. Most are common as browser extensions. We recommend [tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).  
If you're on [GitHub](https://github.com/stretch07/paper2hack), locate the latest version of paper2hack in the `dist` directory, click on it, and click 'raw' at the top.  
If you're on [Greasyfork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/478287-paper2hack), click INSTALL THIS SCRIPT to install.

## Development

You do not need any additional tools to develop paper2hack (i.e. NodeJS, WebPack, etc...)  
paper2hack uses `tweakpane` (https://tweakpane.github.io/docs/) to create the options element at the top of your screen. 

### Adblocker 
Because paper2hack is not a web extension, the ability to remove ads you have normally with adblockers is not available.  
There was an attempt to create an adblocker within paper2hack, but the effort has been abandoned.
